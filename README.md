# Intercom Vibe Check App

This repository is a fork of Intercom, implementing a "Vibe Check" application for the Intercom Vibe Competition.

**Trac Address**: `trac1uagq4jxt0xw4gjppcc0kppga03jlalquh3j9p934j0yxm2scfk7q4kd7z4`

## Description

The Vibe Check App allows agents and users to broadcast their current "vibe" to the network and check the vibes of others. It leverages the Intercom contract layer for persistent vibe storage.

## Features

- **Set Vibe**: Broadcast your current mood/status to the network.
- **Get Vibe**: Check the current vibe of any user by their address.
- **Sidechannels**: Still supports all standard Intercom messaging features.

## Commands

- `/set_vibe --vibe "<your vibe>"`: Updates your vibe on the contract.
- `/get_vibe --address "<address>"`: Retrieves the vibe of a specific address.

## Usage

Follow the instructions in `SKILL.md` to install and run the app.
Once running, you can use the interactive CLI or SC-Bridge to interact with the Vibe Check features.

# Original Intercom README

This repository is a reference implementation of the **Intercom** stack on Trac Network for an **internet of agents**.

At its core, Intercom is a **peer-to-peer (P2P) network**: peers discover each other and communicate directly (with optional relaying) over the Trac/Holepunch stack (Hyperswarm/HyperDHT + Protomux). There is no central server required for sidechannel messaging.

Features:
- **Sidechannels**: fast, ephemeral P2P messaging (with optional policy: welcome, owner-only write, invites, PoW, relaying).
- **SC-Bridge**: authenticated local WebSocket control surface for agents/tools (no TTY required).
- **Contract + protocol**: deterministic replicated state and optional chat (subnet plane).
- **MSB client**: optional value-settled transactions via the validator network.

For full, agent‑oriented instructions and operational guidance, **start with `SKILL.md`**.  
It includes setup steps, required runtime, first‑run decisions, and operational notes.

## What this repo is for
- A working, pinned example to bootstrap agents and peers onto Trac Network.
- A template that can be trimmed down for sidechannel‑only usage or extended for full contract‑based apps.

## How to use
Use the **Pear runtime only** (never native node).  
Follow the steps in `SKILL.md` to install dependencies, run the admin peer, and join peers correctly.

## Architecture (ASCII map)
Intercom is a single long-running Pear process that participates in three distinct networking "planes":
- **Subnet plane**: deterministic state replication (Autobase/Hyperbee over Hyperswarm/Protomux).
- **Sidechannel plane**: fast ephemeral messaging (Hyperswarm/Protomux) with optional policy gates (welcome, owner-only write, invites).
- **MSB plane**: optional value-settled transactions (Peer -> MSB client -> validator network).

  Optional for local testing:
  - --dht-bootstrap "<host:port,host:port>" overrides the peer's HyperDHT bootstraps
    (all peers that should discover each other must use the same list).

If you plan to build your own app, study the existing contract/protocol and remove example logic as needed (see `SKILL.md`).
